# tela.js

Graphic library from scratch, with reference implementation of computer graphics algorithms.

## Purpose

The propose of a graphic engine is to be able to generate images in a computational way. The engine should also be capable to create videos and interactive demos or games. In this engine I want to be able to render complex scenes with dynamic objects with realistic or cartoonish appearance.
