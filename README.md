# tela.js

Graphic library from scratch, with reference implementation of computer graphics algorithms.

## Purpose

The propose of a graphic engine is to be able to generate images in a computational way. This includes drawing geometrical figures, in the plane and in the space. Visualization of further dimensions are only available through [slices of 4th dimensional object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxphFdRDjxM), or through animations of objects.

# Main Features

  - Draw 2D objects
  - Draw 3D objects
  - Generate images
  - Generate video
  - Interactive application
  - Different resolutions
