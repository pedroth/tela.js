# tela.js

Graphic engine from scratch in javascript, with reference implementation of computer graphics algorithms.

# What is a graphic engine?

- A graphic engine, is something that enables the creation of images with a computer. Graphic engines generate images in 2D space, although is possible to visualize higher dimensions using projections to the plane. Famous projections to 3D space include perspective and orthographic projection. Using basic primitives, such as lines and triangles we are able to render the real world. By being able to generate images so quickly, it is possible to generate movies and interactive applications.
