# What is a graphic engine?

A graphic engine, is something that enables the creation of images with a computer. An Image is in a abstract sense a function from the plane to the space of colors. Through the usage of basic primitives, such as lines and triangles the engine is capable of rendering the real world. A graphic engine is also able to generate movies by creating a sequence of images.
